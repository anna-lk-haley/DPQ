Scripts for meshing following the (in revision) paper "Dissipation-Pressure Quotient (DPQ): A Refined Approach for Meshing Cerebral Venous Geometries for High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics." This repo includes DPQ calculation, Laplace solution, slicing and mapping scripts, CFL calculation, y+ calculation and visualization, and a script that extracts walltime and RAM usage.
