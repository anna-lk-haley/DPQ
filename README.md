Scripts for meshing following the (in revision) paper "Dissipation-Pressure Quotient (DPQ): A Refined Approach for Meshing Cerebral Venous Geometries for High-Fidelity Computational Fluid Dynamics." This repo includes DPQ calculation, Laplace solution, slicing and mapping scripts, CFL calculation, y+ calculation and visualization, and a script that extracts walltime and RAM usage. The only scripts that are missing from this workflow are those which were performed locally using VMTK, contained in a repo which is private to all but the BSL group. This repo is available on request.
